### This is a game that was made by me and 3 others over the course of 48 hours. I was the sole programmer on the project and wrote all the code within the 48 hours. The code qulity and commit quality got progressivley worse the further into the 48 hours due to a lack of sleep and too much energy drinks. Like realy that was an unholy amount of Red Bull...
